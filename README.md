##  Approach

- **Data Cleaning:** Cleaned the raw data in Python for missing values, negative quantities/prices, canceled invoices, and outliers  
- **SQL Analysis:** Created relational schema in MySQL with tables for customers, products, invoices, and orders  
- **Python Analysis:** Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore trends and create visualizations

-  Monthly revenue trends (Top 10 products)  
-  Top products by quarter (Revenue & Quantity)  
-  Top products overall (Revenue vs. Quantity)  
-  Top 3 products by country

 All charts are saved in the [`Charts/`](Charts/) folder.
